		<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> OpenNV is in the preliminary stages of development. <i>Don't get your hopes up!</i></p>
		<p>The OpenNV project is a collection of projects related to making Fallout: New Vegas mod development easier and allowing the game and it's mod content to be played on additional platforms. All OpenNV Projects are licensed under the 3-Clause BSD License.</p>
		<p>OpenNV itself (part of, the OpenNV Project) is an engine recreation of the games Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3. It's written in C# and plans on using MOGRE for rendering.</p>
		<p>OpenNVCK is a mod SDK for Fallout: New Vegas, aimed at being easier to use and less crash-prone than New Vegas's Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK). It's written in C# and uses Windows Forms.</p>

		<h2>Current Progress</h2>
		<p>Current development efforts are focused on OpenNVCK. Code will be committed once the OpenNVCK is in a usable state.</p>

		<h2>Major Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			Current major challeneges are:
			<ul>
				<li>Parsing middleware formats used by New Vegas and making them usable ingame, in order of most-to-least expected difficulty:
					<ul>
						<li>FaceGen</li>
						<li>SpeedTree</li>
						<li>Bink Video</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>General lack of documentation on formats used by the the Fallout 3/New Vegas engine.</li>
			</ul>
